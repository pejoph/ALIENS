A.L.I.E.N.S (Advanced Lightspeed Inter-planetary Expedition Navigation Squad)
is a multiplayer co-operative chaotic communication game in which players attempt to navigate
a harsh alien planet in a makeshift robot.

Each player controls one part of the robot in order to avoid obstacles, collect energy sources,
shield the robot from projectiles, repair the robot, or shoot hostile aliens.

Things on this planet are not as they appear and certain obstacles can only been seen through
special electromagnetic goggles, with each player tuned into a different frequency.

This means that players must communicate obstacles that they see and listen out for obstacles
seen by others.

After each wave, under threat of self-detonation (from a crewmate suffering from space madness),
all players must swap positions and get used to a new role.

Survive until you reach the research station to win.
